# Vision

Vision is an app that recognizes objects in images. The application uses the MobileNet model which allows classification for a 1000 categories.

This project is quite similar to and is inspired by the TF Classify app in the TensorFlow Android examples, but is implemented using the TFLite library for faster inference on mobile.
